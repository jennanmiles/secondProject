## Overview
This is my updated portfolio page using bootstrap styles. I added their styles to the nav bar, main container, and my form and form button. I maintained my initial look and feel, so many of my styles are my own. However, I relied upon bootstrap to make my page predominately responsive. 

## Extras
Bootstrap was implemented into:
* nav bar
* main wrapper
* form & button
